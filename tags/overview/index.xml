      <title>How Is OKR Different From OKC?</title>

      <description>OKR is a framework. A framework is a broad but incomplete structure which supports an approach to achieve an outcome. A framework leaves room to add and remove practices and tools.
OKC is an opinionated methodology that has a defined set of principles, tools, and practices. OKC operates within the OKR framework. The OKC methodology is not a list of suggestions or choices. Even though the elements of OKC individually have value, the real value comes from applying all aspects of the methodology.</description>

      <title>What is an Objective?</title>

      <description>Objectives are concise statements that describe what you want to achieve. They should inspire, engage, challenge, and motivate the team. Objectives are time-bound and qualitative.
On May 25, 1961, John F. Kennedy before the joint session of congress, set the following national goal:
 “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.</description>

      <title>Commit to Ensure Your Success</title>

      <description>According to a recent study done by U.S. News, 80% of New Year’s resolution makers become New Year’s resolution breakers by the second week of February. Similarly, many organizations suffer a similar fate with their OKR implementation. A common mistake many teams make with their objectives and key results is that they “set and forget” goals.
In both cases, the reason they fail is that they don’t take small steps and review progress on a regular basis.</description>

      <title>How to Sustain OKC</title>
      <link>http://www.okcommit.com/learn/how-to-sustain-okrs/</link>

      <description>While OKC principles seem simple, sustaining the process is harder than you think. Organizations implementing OKC will run into three issues:
 The novelty wears off in about 8 to 10 weeks. Team members will lose interest without reinforcement. The internal or external conditions may change. New opportunities or threats emerge that may impact an objective. The team’s assumption and predictions were wrong for their objective and key results. With OKC, you are making both strategic and execution bets.</description>

      <title>What Is a Key Result?</title>
      <link>http://www.okcommit.com/learn/what-is-a-key-result/</link>

      <guid>http://www.okcommit.com/learn/what-is-a-key-result/</guid>
      <description>Key results measure your progress towards achievement of a given objective. If the objective is the “what”, the key result is the “how” – how you will know if you succeeded. Key results are quantitative and will use a number in the statement. The sum of the key results will result in a desired outcome for the objective and drive the right behavior. The key results must also be measurable. If you can’t collect the data, then you can’t measure your progress towards the key result.</description>

      <title>The Answer Is to Focus on What Matters</title>

      <description>Many consider Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, the father of OKRs. In his book, High Output Management, he first spoke about “Objectives and Key Results” regarding running a successful management by objectives (MBO) system. He stated:
 The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say “no”—in this case, to too many objectives.</description>

      <title>Change Is Hard</title>

      <description>Why is change so hard for your team members? In particular, if the strategic objectives are so important to the organization, why do team members struggle to execute against their goals? Some reasons could include:
 The goals are unrealistic to achieve or lack clarity. Sometimes, there are too many goals to complete for a team member. In other cases, the goal might not be influenceable. As a result, the team member does not believe they will succeed.</description>

      <title>From Mission to Vision: Your Organization Strategy</title>
      <link>http://www.okcommit.com/learn/from-mission-to-vision-your-organization-strategy/</link>

      <description>OKC fits within the broader strategic context of an organization.
Your organization should have both a mission and a set of values. The mission answers the question “Why do we exist?” The organizational values are traits or qualities that the organization considers worthwhile and define how you should behave. The outer box in diagram represents your mission and values. Your mission and values help the organization understand what “is in” and what “is out” of the box.</description>
